# Welcome to my Portfolio
## Portfolio Description

What you're about to witness in my portfolio is a glimpse of the projects I have worked on and have been part of, as you will explore both the code and the demo to them. While on the journey you will know a bit more about my friendly, creative personality and my love for coding expressed through the soft skills I possess that push me forward; and a little blogging space that allows me to showcase my coding journey to help others overcome obstacles I've faced to grow in the field. Last but not least, you will find the way to contact me hopefully.
